Open-source, encryption-first content platform powered by [SatsRail](https://satsrail.com) Bitcoin Lightning payments. Sell any type of media — video, audio, articles, photo sets, podcasts — with instant, non-custodial payments. No payment processor accounts, no chargebacks, no middlemen.

All content is encrypted at rest. The server never stores plaintext, never decrypts content, and never touches customer funds. Decryption happens entirely in the buyer's browser after payment. SatsRail manages encryption keys and payment verification but never sees your content.

Fork it, deploy it, sell whatever you want through it.

## Get Running in 2 Minutes

You need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. That's it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatsRail/privapaid_app.git
cd privapaid_app
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). A setup wizard walks you through everything:

1. Name your instance and pick a theme color
2. Paste your SatsRail API key (from your [SatsRail merchant dashboard](https://satsrail.com))

Done. Log in with your SatsRail merchant credentials and start creating channels.

Encryption keys and auth secrets are generated automatically on first run.

## Deploy to the Cloud

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for EC2, Docker, and other deployment options.

## Content Import

Populate your instance from a JSON file — either the entire site (categories, channels, and media) or media for a single channel.

### Whole-Site Import

Upload a JSON file at **Admin > Import / Export** to create categories, channels, and media in one pass.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "categories": [
    { "slug": "bitcoin-education", "name": "Bitcoin Education", "position": 1 }
  ],
  "channels": [
    {
      "slug": "beginner",
      "name": "Level 1 — Beginner",
      "bio": "Start here.",
      "category_slug": "bitcoin-education",
      "nsfw": false,
      "product": {
        "name": "Full Channel Access",
        "price_cents": 500,
        "currency": "USD",
        "access_duration_seconds": 2592000
      },
      "media": [
        {
          "ref": 1,
          "name": "What is Bitcoin?",
          "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
          "media_type": "video",
          "position": 1,
          "product": {
            "name": "What is Bitcoin? — Individual",
            "price_cents": 100,
            "currency": "USD",
            "access_duration_seconds": 604800
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Channel Import

Add media to an existing channel at **Admin > Channels > [channel] > Import**. The file contains only a media array.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "media": [
    {
      "ref": 1,
      "name": "Episode Title",
      "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
      "media_type": "video",
      "position": 1,
      "product": {
        "name": "Episode Title",
        "price_cents": 100,
        "currency": "USD",
        "access_duration_seconds": 604800
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported media types: `video`, `audio`, `article`, `photo_set`, `podcast`.

Each media item can include a `product` with pricing — the import automatically creates the corresponding SatsRail product and encrypts the source URL. Imports are idempotent: re-importing with the same slugs or refs updates existing records.

## Architecture

### Encryption at Rest

Every piece of content in PrivaPaid is encrypted before it touches the database. There is no unencrypted storage path — this is enforced, not optional.

Each product in SatsRail carries a 32-byte AES-256-GCM encryption key. When an admin associates media with a product, the source URL is encrypted with that product's key and stored as a `MediaProduct` record in MongoDB. No plaintext source URL is ever persisted in the database. The URL exists in server memory only for the instant it takes to encrypt (at upload time and during key rotation re-encryption), then is discarded.

A single media item can be sold through multiple products (individually, as part of a bundle, etc.). Each product-media combination produces a separately encrypted blob locked with that product's key. Media cannot be uploaded until a product exists and its encryption key is available — the upload gate enforces this.

The blob format is `Base64(IV[12] + ciphertext + auth_tag[16])`. The browser splits the IV from the ciphertext+tag and decrypts using the Web Crypto API. The server plays no role in decryption.

### Content Gating

Content on a media page exists in one of three states:

| State | Condition | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Unavailable** | No `MediaProduct` records exist (no encrypted blobs) | "Unavailable" overlay shown. Payment buttons disabled. No invoice is created. |
| **Locked** | Encrypted blobs exist but no valid access token | "Pay to Watch" overlay with pricing tiers. Lightning payment flow available. |
| **Unlocked** | Valid access token + successful decryption | Content plays. Blur removed. Source URL loaded from decrypted blob. |

The unavailable state prevents charging for content that can't be delivered — if there's no encrypted blob, there's no key to sell and no URL to decrypt. This short-circuits before any payment UI appears.

### Payment and Key Delivery

1. Buyer selects a product and pays a Lightning invoice
2. SatsRail confirms payment and issues a macaroon (signed access token) plus the product's decryption key
3. Key is delivered to the browser via HTTP polling through the stream app's own API routes
4. Browser decrypts the encrypted blob using Web Crypto API and loads the content
5. Macaroon is stored in an httpOnly cookie for return visits — it encodes `product_id` and an expiry, not the key itself

On return visits, the browser presents its macaroon to the stream app's `/api/macaroons` route, which proxies the verification request to SatsRail server-side. If the signature is valid and the token hasn't expired, the current product key is returned. No re-payment required. Macaroons survive key rotation because they reference `product_id`, not the key.

### Key Rotation

Products support admin-controlled key rotation with a two-key window:

1. Admin triggers rotation — current key moves to `old_key`, new key is generated
2. Product enters "rotation pending" state — media uploads are blocked, admin sees a badge
3. Admin triggers re-encryption — PrivaPaid decrypts each blob with `old_key` and re-encrypts with the new key, streaming progress
4. On success, `old_key` is cleared via the SatsRail API — rotation is complete

During the rotation window, existing buyers' macaroons remain valid but decryption will fail until re-encryption completes. This is pull-based by design — no webhooks are relied upon because they may not reach the destination.

### External References and SatsRail Blindness

PrivaPaid generates opaque `external_ref` values that SatsRail stores but never interprets. These refs encode scope and attribution using prefixes: `ch_` for channels, `md_` for individual media items. SatsRail uses them for revenue grouping and product lookup, but has zero knowledge of what they point to.

When a channel is created, PrivaPaid assigns an auto-incrementing numeric ref and creates a corresponding ProductType on SatsRail (`external_ref: ch_7`). When media is associated with a product, the product gets `external_ref: md_12`. This decouples payment identity from display identity — slugs are user-facing and editable, refs are stable and opaque.

Revenue attribution flows through these refs: channel earnings are grouped by ProductType, media earnings by `external_ref` within the type. No channel ID, media ID, or content type flag is needed on the order model.
